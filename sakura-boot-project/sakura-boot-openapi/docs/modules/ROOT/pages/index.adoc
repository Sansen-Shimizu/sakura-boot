:description: Sakura Boot — openapi module — main page documentation

[discrete]
=== More than documentation for rest API.

The openapi module creates openapi documentation for the entire application.

== Convention over code

The openapi module only contains a configuration file and annotation that can be used in the controller to create additional documentation.

For example, to add documentation to a basic controller class, it is only necessary to add the module in the dependencies.

It is possible to add custom logic or modify the default behavior if necessary.

== Getting started

For new users of the framework the xref:quickstart.adoc[] page will help create a simple application using the openapi module.

For more details on the installation instructions, see xref:installation.adoc[].

To see all the different modules, go to xref:sakura-boot::modules.adoc[].
