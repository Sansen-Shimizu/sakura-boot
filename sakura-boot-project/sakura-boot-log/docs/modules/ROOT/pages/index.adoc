=== Simplify the logging for any application

The log module can be used to simplify the logging of any method.

== Convention over code

For all the classes inherited from the log module class or interface, only a few lines of code are required.
All the defaults are defined in the module class itself.

For example, to log all the methods of a basic service or controller class, it is only necessary to implement the Loggable interface.

== Getting started

For new users of the framework the xref:quickstart.adoc[] page will help create a simple application using the log module.

For more details on the installation instructions, see xref:installation.adoc[].

To see all the different modules, go to xref:sakura-boot::modules.adoc[].
