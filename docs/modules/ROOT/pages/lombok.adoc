:description: Sakura Boot lombok page documentation

https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok,window=_blank] is a great library for code generation.
It works perfectly with Sakura Boot and can remove a lot of boilerplate code.
Simple class that inherits from default Sakura Boot behavior and use lombok can be created with just a few lines of code.

== Warning

Every lombok annotation can’t be used in every case.

For example, an entity mustn’t use the @Data annotation. +
See this https://stackoverflow.com/a/75182787[StackOverflow answer,window=_blank] for more details.

For any lombok annotations that are used, it must be verified that no problem will occur. +
The getter, constructor, and builder annotation are generally safe to use.
