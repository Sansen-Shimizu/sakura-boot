== Introduction

This framework, built on top of Spring Boot, is designed to speed up the development of robust backends.
It ensures adherence to best practices while allowing a high degree of customization.
The framework is structured using a modular architecture, making it easy to add or remove features based on the project’s specific needs.

*Who should use this framework?*

* Developers with Spring Boot Experience: +
This framework can help developers who’re already familiar with Spring Boot.
** *Faster Development*: By using built-in configurations and pre-defined templates, this framework significantly reduces development time. +
** *Best Practices Enforcement*: It ensures that the code adheres to best practices, reducing the risk of common mistakes.
** *Highly Customizable*: The framework’s modular architecture allows developers to easily extend or modify functionality by adding or removing modules.
It also includes a variety of tests for unit, integration, and functional testing.
Developers can start with a quick, functional application and then gradually add custom logic or additional libraries as required.
* Developers with Little or No Experience in Java or Spring Boot: +
This framework can also help for those new to Java development or Spring Boot:
** *Ease of Use*: Even developers with minimal Java experience can build reliable and maintainable backends using this framework.
It abstracts much of the complexity of setting up a backend by providing production-ready default.
** *Comprehensive Guidance*: Through well-documented Javadoc with example and pre-built modules, the framework helps developers avoid common pitfalls while ensuring that their applications are built on solid foundations.

*Modular Architecture*

One of the key strengths of this framework is its modular design.
Modules can be easily added or removed, allowing developers to tailor the application to their specific needs.
The framework includes a variety of pre-built modules, such as +

* Caching +
* DTO mapping +
* Filtering +
* Logging +
* Hypermedia support(HATEOAS) +
* OPENAPI documentation

*Purpose*

This framework doesn’t intend to replace Spring Boot but instead complements it by enhancing the development process.
It also integrates widely used libraries such as Hibernate, MapStruct, ...
Spring boot is known for its convention over configuration, while retaining this important feature, Sakura boot introduces a convention over programming, providing predefined interface, class, and methods.
Developers can start quickly with a modular, efficient solution while retaining the ability to customize every aspect of their application as needed.

*Why Version 0.1.0?*

The framework is still in early stage of development.
While the core functionality is operational, users should be aware that there are still potential bugs and improvements to be addressed.
Additionally, some modules, such as security, auditing, and others, are yet to be implemented before reaching a stable 1.0.0 release.

Despite being in version 0.1.0, the framework can still be used for developing production-ready backends today.
However, it may require more testing due to the possibility of bugs, and some key features may need to be added manually using spring boot.
Moreover, developers should be cautious of potential breaking changes in future updates before the 1.0.0 release.

Feel free to raise issues, propose enhancements, and contribute to the framework.
Feedback will be taken into consideration to help reach a stable 1.0.0 release.

== Prerequisites & Installation Instructions

=== Prerequisites

The framework uses Java 21 for its modern features, and it is the latest LTS JDK release.
Currently, no backward compatibility with older versions is planned.

Maven or Gradle are recommended.

=== Installation

To install with predefined dependencies for a production-ready application, follow this step:

* With Maven:

This includes the basic functionalities of sakura boot, the necessary spring boot starter, and a runtime postgresql.

[,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot</groupId>
        <artifactId>sakura-boot-starter-predefined-basic</artifactId>
        <version>${org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

This includes all the modules of sakura boot, the necessary spring boot starter, mapstruct, ehcache3 as cache provider, and a runtime postgresql.

[,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot</groupId>
        <artifactId>sakura-boot-starter-predefined-all-module</artifactId>
        <version>${org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

* With Gradle:

This includes the basic functionalities of sakura boot, the necessary spring boot starter, and a runtime postgresql.

[,kotlin]
----
implementation("org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot:sakura-boot-starter-predefined-basic:LATEST_VERSION")
----

This includes all the modules of sakura boot, the necessary spring boot starter, mapstruct, ehcache3 as cache provider, and a runtime postgresql.

[,kotlin]
----
implementation("org.sansenshimizu.sakuraboot:sakura-boot-starter-predefined-all-module:LATEST_VERSION")
----

For custom dependencies that include necessary dependencies, starters without predefined are also available:

* sakura-boot-starter-basic
* sakura-boot-starter-all-module

Starters are also available for test with:

* sakura-boot-starter-basic-unit-test
* sakura-boot-starter-basic-integration-test
* sakura-boot-starter-basic-functional-test
* Same for all-module and predefined.

For more fine-grained control over dependencies, import directly from each module:

* sakura-boot-basic
* sakura-boot-cache
* ...
* sakura-boot-basic-test
* sakura-boot-cache-test
* sakura-boot-functional-test
* ...

== Documentation

The project documentation is located in the link:./docs/[documentation] folder, and available will be available soon at
https://sansenshimizu.org/sakuraboot.

All the classes are well-documented with Javadoc and example.

link:./example-project/[Example projects] are available to help understand how to use the framework in different basic situations.
